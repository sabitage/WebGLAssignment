This content was created for a WebGL assignment, by completing the 
WebGL tutorial at http://www.semayjohnston.com/example.html, for the 
class CSCI 2160 Digital Media. The tutorial was updated to use the 
newest version of three.js and to run the traditional teapot model 
instead of the hemostat model. 

To complete the assignment a license for the content was required to 
be chosen. The WTFPL license was chosen. The reasoning behind this 
choice was because it offers total freedom. The assignment was 
completed following a tutorial, which anyone can follow, so the 
result should be accessible to all those who are interested in using 
it as a reference when completing the same tutorial or a similar 
project themselves. 

And the license is funny so why not.
